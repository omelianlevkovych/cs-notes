# building abstractions with procedures
We are about to study the idea of a **computational process**.  
As they evolve (computers), processes manipulate other abstract thigs called **data**.  

Def: The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a **program**.  
People create programs to direct (manipulate) processes.  

A computational process is indeed much like a spirit. It cannot be touched or seen. It is not composed of any matter at all. However, it is very real. It can perform intelectual work. It can answer questions.  

(Hah it remind me old good times from rational and hpmor):
Thus, like the sorcerer's apprentice, novice programmers must learn to understand and to anticipate the consequences of their conjuring. Even small errors (usually called bugs or glitches) in programs can have complex and unanticipated consequences.  

Well designed computational systems, like well-designed automobiles or nuclear reactors, are designed in a **modular manner**, so that the parts can be constructed, replaced, and debugged separetly.
