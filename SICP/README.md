# overall
I have decided to read SICP as much as I can and have motivation to.  
I also will try to do as many exercises as I could.  

# setup
I am just compiling it in my browser, just follow https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa14/assets/interpreter/scheme.html  
Maybe in future I should figure out how to set up it locally and provide docs for it, however 
currently I am mostly focused on learning the concepts from CISP.

# structure
I will try to create dir for each chapter which will contain some notes and exercises.  
I will start writing exercises in text editor without any IDE etc;  


# symbols in exercise
; - represents comments line
>> represents my answer (some additional inputs I will put it the comments as well)
