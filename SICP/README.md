So ask yourself whether what you most need at the moment is a course whose main purpose will be to force you to think outside the usual paradigms, and decide if it is worth the time commitment.  
I have decided to start focusing on advanced data structures and algorithms first; than moving to this again  

# overall
I have decided to read SICP as much as I can and have motivation to.  
I also will try to do as many exercises as I could.  

# setup
I am just compiling it in my browser, just follow https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa14/assets/interpreter/scheme.html  
Maybe in future I should figure out how to set up it locally and provide docs for it, however 
currently I am mostly focused on learning the concepts from CISP.

# structure
I will try to create dir for each chapter which will contain some notes and exercises.  
I will start writing exercises in text editor without any IDE etc;  


# symbols in exercise
";" - represents comments line
">>" represents my answer (some additional inputs I will put it the comments as well)
