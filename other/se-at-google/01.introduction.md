# software engineering at google; lessons learned from people over time
Overall based on the first 50 pages or so this is a really great book, I will give it the second try (decided to read it more focused from laptop while taking notes to revisit in future).  

# why to read it
This book will give you ideas on how things could be done, and a lot of information that you can use to strength your arguments  for adopting best practices like testing, knowleadge sharing, and building collaborative teams. But it does not mean you have to or obligated to follow all the recommentations.  
**It is always about trade offs.**

# programming over time
SE is not just the act of writing code, but all of the **tools** and **processes** an organization uses to **build** and **maintain** that **code over time**.  

software engineering is a programming integrated over time.  

this book emphasizes **three fundamental priniples** to keep in mind when designing, architecting, and writing code:
* Time and Change - how code will need to adapt over the length of its life
* Scale and Growth - how to adapt as it evolves
* Trade-offs nad Costs - make decisions on the lessons of Time and Change & Scale and Growth

# three main aspects of software landscape
* culture
* processes
* tools

## What is SE?
