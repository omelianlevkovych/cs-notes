# jargon
* _producing_ means sending. A program that send messages is a _producer_.
* a _queue_ is a name for post box which lives inside RMQ. Although messages can only
be stored inside a _queue_. A queue is only bound by the host's memory & disk limits, it's
essentially a large message buffer. Many _producers_ can send messages that got to one queue,
and many _consumers_ can try to receive data from one _queue_.
* _consuming_ has a similar meaning to receiving. A _consumer_ is a program that mostly waits
to receive messages.

Note that producer, consumer, and broker do not have to reside on the same host; indeed in most
applicaitons they don't.  
An applicaiton can be both a producer and consumer.
