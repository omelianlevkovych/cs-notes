# Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications
It open your eyes on several important skills in the science and art of developing complex systems.  

Has 3 major sections:
- Concepts. Complexity of software and ways to manage it.
- Method. Method for the development of complex systems.
- Application. Five nontrivial examples of problem domains.

# Concepts
## Complexity
Read a bit more about ```abstractions```; it looks like people operates them pretty naturally.  
By the way, do not forget, that all that OOP, structural, FP thing is basically created only for us (humans). Computers
do not care about all that abstraction levels, they operate bites.  

The science of complexity calls this emergent behavior:  
```The behavior of the whole is greater than the sum of its parts```.


The industrial (enterprise) applications are actually complex.  
```The distinguishing characteristics of industrial-strength software is that it is intensely difficult, if not impossible,```
```for the individual developer to comprehend all the subtleties of the design.```.  
```The compexity of such systems exceeds the human intellectual capacity.```  
So? Well, you should aim to get the bigger picture
and have a skills to dig into details when it is really needed. Use abstraction as friend and not a foe.  


```The complexity of software is an essential property, not an accidental one```. It derives from:
- the complexity of the problem domain
- the diffuculty of managing the development process
- software will always grow and change, it brings compexity
- the problems of characterizing the behavior of discrete systems
